# Origin Home UI

A simple UI design of the Origin Games Homepage.  
I didn't have internet data :disappointed_relieved: to do what I was doing so I decided to have some fun :wink: .  
Then when I finally got data in the evening :dancer: , I added the liquid progress package and called it a day :heavy_check_mark: :ok: .
